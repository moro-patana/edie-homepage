## Overview

![screenshot](https://iili.io/KT71l2.png)


-   Here you can find the demo: https://edie-homepage-manjaka.netlify.app
-   I experienced that it is good to devide your code into multiple sections to help you with the layout. It is also a huge design so you can start your html step by step 
example: build the header and the main header first and that is followed by the next section or article.

### Built With

-   [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Features
- I divided my html into multiple article.
- Each article has class as their function
e.g: services is one article, contact is one article and so on.
- I linked each article to their function. When the user click the services, they will find the services article.
